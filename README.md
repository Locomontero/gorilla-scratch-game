# About Soldecoder

We are a tech-based NFT project, with a website and bots to help users generate Alpha. We also have alpha generating Discord bots anyone can add, including Engage-2-Earn and WL tools. We've recently integrated OpenAI chat bots with Discord, and are focusing on AI tools in our website in the future.

The website and tools provide a search engine that gathers data from private (paid) DAO Discord channels, Twitter accounts, and web3 companies, such as Magic Eden, Famous Fox Federation, and others.

The data is used in different tools we have built for ETH & SOL, such as alerts/calls, alpha, charts, graphs, evaluation, hyperlinks, and keyword searching. Besides the website and discord, you can download our app in the Android and Apple stores.

We have also built a tool to grow and built your community/project called "Engage-2-earn", which can be used by other DAOs too.

## Scratchcard Game

The daily reward game of Soldecoder project.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## About Scratchcard Game
